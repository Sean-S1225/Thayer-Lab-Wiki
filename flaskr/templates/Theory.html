    It's easy to take for granted how much we use sight in scientific research. So much of science is
    running simulations, watching and seeing what happens, then drawing conclusions and running more test.
    This becomes impossible when your target of research shrinks below a certain size. Namely, proteins are
    far too small to be observed directly.
</p>

<p>
    Methods of studying proteins indirectly have developed tremendously over the past century, but still prove
    incapable of answering some of the most important questions in biology, such as how allosteric <em>actually</em>
    propogate through a protein, or more specific questions, such as, "does the introduction of the drug PK11000 to
    the Y220C mutation of p53 restore wild type activity?".
</p>

<p>
    This is where Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations come in. They allow us to probe the lowest levels of protein
    dynamics to understand this hidden world.
</p>

<p>
    An MD simulation consists of a system of atoms, and a physics model governing the interactions between these atoms.
    The system typically contains the protein of interest, in a "box" of water.
    MD simulations tracks the positions and velocities of these atoms over the course of a simulation, which are
    typically on a nanosecond (one billionth of a second) or microsecond (one millionth of a second) time scale.
</p>

<p>
    From this data, a trajectory is created, which contains the data generated (positions and velocities) in the simulation.
    This data can then be studied to answer questions such as the ones posed above: the electrostatic energetics of 
    system can be studied to try to observe allosteric pathways; the deviations of the proteins over time can be
    analyzed to see if the mutated Y220C p53 occupies different conformational states than the wild type or mutated and drugged
    protein.
</p>

<p>
    The first MD simulation was performed in the late 1950s on simple gasses, and the first MD simulation 
    performed on a protein was done in the 1970s. Due to an explosion in the number of protein structures 
    available and the amount of computational resources available, the number of MD simulations appearing
    in publications has drastically increased. The number of papers using MD simulations doubled between
    2007 and 2017, going from only 400 to over 1000.
</p>

<p>
    There are three main MD simulation packages, Amber, GROMACS, and LAMMPS, though they do essentially
    the same thing, though LAMMPS is typically for larger systems. 
</p>

<p>
    An MD simulation operates on this formula (or some slight variation of it):

<p>
    Running an MD simulation typically consists of five steps:
